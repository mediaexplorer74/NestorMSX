Z80.NET Release Notes
---------------------

* v1.0.2

- FIX: Fixed the flags 3 and 5 calculation for the CP instructions.
       Now the Z80Processor class passes the ZEXALL test except for the BIT instruction.
	   
- NEW: Z80Processor.ClockSyncrhonizer can now be set to null in order to disable
       clock syncrhonization, so that the simulation runs at the maximum speed
	   provided by the host system.


* v1.0.1

- FIX: Invoking ExecutionStopper.Stop from the BerforeInstructionFetch event
       was throwing InstructionFetchFinishedEventNotFiredException.

- FIX: Flags calculation was wrong for ADD, ADC, SUB, SBC, CP, NEG and DAA instructions.
       With this fix the Z80Processor class passes the ZEXDOC test
       (https://github.com/KnightOS/z80e/blob/master/gpl/zexdoc.src).
